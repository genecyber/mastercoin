After more than a year of operations, it's time to define our core values.
The purpose of a core value document is to capture and communicate the reason for the existence of the Foundation.

Please treat the following as a proposal only until this document is approved by the board and this line is deleted.

These values can be treated like [Asimov's laws of robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics). Each value is upheld except when it contradicts with a previous value.

0. Do good. There is no agreed upon definition of "doing good" so this must be left for the individual to interpert.
1. [Radical Honesty](http://www.radicalhonesty.com/) - We will never lie.
2. Transparency - we will seek to voluntarily broadcast the maximal amount of information we can to the public.
3. Freedom - we will seek to maximize the freedom and rights enjoyed by any individual or group. 
4. Dedication - Do. Or do not. [There is no try](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ4yd2W50No).
